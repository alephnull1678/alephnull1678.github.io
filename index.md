[DocxMCP](#)
<img src="images/dummy_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>

MCP server that gives MCP-compatible LLM clients like Claude Code the ability to read `.docx` text and images.  
- Experimented with phased project planning in Claude Code and Goose to create AI-assisted code that followed human development workflows.  
- Created custom agents that work sequentially to decompose tasks and fix issues.  


[Sunset Swing](#)
<img src="images/dummy_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>

Unity game where players swing through an infinite procedurally generated city with a dynamic physics system.  
- Built to scratch the same “satisfying traversal” itch as games like slowroads.io and Clustertruck, with room for skill expression and speed.  
- Implemented custom physics using Vector and Quaternion calculations to keep swinging smooth and responsive.  
- Full adaptive audio implementation and hand-crafted art and music assets.


- **SEE-R** — Arduino distance detector that measures proximity and can be used in small hardware demos.  
- **Crayon Samurai** — Python game project exploring gameplay, visuals, and input handling.
