### Projects

#### DocxMCP
<img src="images/docxmcplogo.png?raw=true"/>

MCP server that gives MCP-compatible LLM clients like Claude Code the ability to read `.docx` text and images.  
- Experimented with phased project planning in Claude Code and Goose to create AI-assisted code that followed human development workflows.  
- Created custom agents that work sequentially to decompose tasks and fix issues.

#### Sunset Swing

Unity game where players swing through an infinite procedurally generated city with a dynamic physics system.  
- Built to scratch the same “satisfying traversal” itch as games like slowroads.io and Clustertruck, with room for skill expression and speed.  
- Implemented custom physics using Vector and Quaternion calculations to keep swinging smooth and responsive.  
- Full adaptive audio implementation and hand-crafted art and music assets.
